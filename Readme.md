# Create a platform for Nutella lovers

### Principle

The site allows anyone to find a healthy substitute for food considered "Too Fatty, Too Sweet, Too Salty". In addition, the user can create an account to save substitutes for the purpose of consulting them later.

### Site link

https://purbeurre-alimentation.herokuapp.com

### How it works

The site retrieves the products and their information from the OpenFoodFacts API. User accounts and favorites are saved in an SQL database which interacts with the backend using Python MySQL Connector. The backend of the site is managed with Python Django.
